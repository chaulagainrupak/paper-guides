    <h2>Welcome to Paper-<span class="blue-highlight">Guides</span>!</h2>
    <p>
        Our paper guides initiative is a student-run effort dedicated to
        providing free study materials to fellow students. We understand the
        challenges of academics and aim to support each other through accessible
        resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are Open-Source

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
        We believe that education should be accessible to everyone, regardless
        of financial constraints. Our mission is to compile and distribute
        high-quality study materials that cover a wide range of subjects and
        topics.
    </p>

    <h3>What We Offer</h3>
    <p>
        Through our platform, you can find comprehensive study guides,
        summaries, practice questions, and more. All materials are created and
        curated by students for students, ensuring relevance and reliability.
    </p>

    <h3>Community-Driven</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
        At the heart of our initiative is a strong sense of community. We
        encourage collaboration among students by allowing contributions and
        feedback. This ensures that our resources remain up-to-date and
        reflective of the current academic curriculum.
    </p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>
        Using our website is simple and intuitive. Navigate through different
        subjects or use our search function to find specific topics. Each
        resource is tagged and categorized for easy browsing.
    </p>

        join our mission. Whether you excel in content creation, editing, or
